#  Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare

## Features:
- An interactive dashboard that allows the user to select from a list of different sample IDs.
- Demographic and metadata is displayed for the selected Sample ID.
- A bar chart displays the Top 10 OTU sample counts for the selected Sample ID.
- A bubble chart shows all OTUs for the selected Sample ID. Size and Colours are based on the sample counts.
- A gauge chart shows the frequency of belly button scrubs per week for the selected Sample ID.

#### Code:
- This week I received assistance from tutorial staff to clear problems in the code.
- AI was helpful in debugging and providing additional resources, such as a [gradient colour designer](https://colordesigner.io/gradient-generator).
- The page has been deployed using [Git Pages](https://gigodata.github.io/projects/belly_button/index.html), as per the instructions in the assignment
